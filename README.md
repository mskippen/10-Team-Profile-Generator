## Description

The above video is a demonstration of how this 'deployed' application works. Created to generate TEAM PROFILE files that use a consistent format.

- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
- THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
- THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- WHEN I click on the GitHub username
- THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- WHEN I start the application
- THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- WHEN I select the engineer option
- THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- WHEN I select the intern option
- THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- WHEN I decide to finish building my team
- THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
